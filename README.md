# SwiftUIToolBox

Collection of my SwiftUI experiments and findings.

## Handle Keyboard

Show a way to handle keyboard event with an environment object. Check [Responding to Keyboard in SwiftUI](https://github.com/Jimmy-Lee/Notes/blob/master/Notes/Responding%20to%20Keyboard%20in%20SwiftUI.md) for more details.

This is a simplified implementation of [this dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/1850527-Music-Player-Transition).

## Audio Equalizer

Set equalizer parameters through a @Binding, control equalizer on the fly in SwiftUI.

## Photos and Permission

Demonstrate a method to handle `PHAuthorizationStatus`

If app is authorized, display photos.

If app has never prompted permission request, prompt it.

Otherwise, show Settings link
