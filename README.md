# SwiftUIToolBox

Collection of my SwiftUI experiments and findings.

## Handle Keyboard

Show a way to handle keyboard event with an environment object. Check [Responding to Keyboard in SwiftUI](https://github.com/Jimmy-Lee/Notes/blob/master/Notes/Responding%20to%20Keyboard%20in%20SwiftUI.md) for more details.

## Expandable Cards

Demonstrate simple animation that was hard in UIKit, but quite simple in SwiftUI.

## Transition Animation

This is a simplified implementation of [this dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/1850527-Music-Player-Transition).

Demonstrate complex animation can be done in SwiftUI.
